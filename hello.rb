 +# Remote repositories
 +
 +There are two ways to set up repository on GitHub
 +
 +Using an existing local repository and then creating it on github
 +* OR *
 +Creating an empty repository on github first and then cloning it locally
 +
 +
 +## Step Two: Using an existing local repository and then creating it on github
 +1. Create a github repository for the project
 +2. In your local version, set up the remote repository as "origin". (Follow the instructions on your github page)
 +3. Check your repository's status, get in the habit of reading
 +4. Push your project to github
 +5. Refresh the github page and see your changes have been uploaded to your remote repository
 +6. Make changes to your "hello.rb" file
 +7. Check the repo's status
 +8. Stage your changes
 +9. Check the repo's status
 +10. Create a new commit with a meaningful message
 +11. Check your repo's status
 +12. Push the code to github (origin)
 +13. Refresh the github page and see your changes have been uploaded to your remote repository

 +(BONUS)
 +If you're done:
 +1. delete the github repo you just created
 +2. look up how to "unset a remote repository"
 +3. start all over again!
 +
 +## Step Three: Creating an empty repository on github first and then cloning it locally
 +1. Create a new github repository. Name it whatever you like.
 +2. Find the clone url (git@...) on the page. You can change it from http
 +3. Clone the repository
 +4. Move into the directory
 +5. Create a new directory inside your project
 +6. Check the status of the repo - why can't you see the directory you just created?
 +7. Move into the new directory and create a new empty file called "joke.rb"
 +8. Open the file with Sublime and have it output "Why did the chicken cross the road?". Save it!
 +9. Check your repo's status - what's different ?
 +10. Stage your changes
 +11. Check the repo's status
 +12. Create a new commit with a meaningful message
 +13. Push the code to github (origin)
